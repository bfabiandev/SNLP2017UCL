# SNLP2017UCL
Group project for SNLP - Story Understanding

In this assignment, we were given a dataset of stories, each consisting of 5 sentences, and the task was to find the correct order of these sentences.
We divided this task into 3 subtasks:
+ Tokenisation, constructing a vocabulary and creating word embeddings.
+ Creating sentence embeddings using the word embeddings.
+ Making sentence order predictions based on the sentence embeddings.
